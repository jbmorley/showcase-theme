# Showcase Theme

Minimal Jekyll theme for showcasing my apps.

## Overview

This is exclusively intended to showcase the [various apps I write](https://jbmorley.co.uk/software), so you might not find it that helpful for your own use cases. That said, there are few ideas in here which might serve as useful inspiration, including a very lightweight take on the kind of documentation generated by [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/).

## Plugins

This theme expects the following plugins:

  - [jekyll-environment-variables](https://github.com/atticoos/jekyll-environment-variables)
  - jekyll-feed
  - [jekyll-gfm-admonitions](https://helveg.github.io/jekyll-gfm-admonitions/)
  - [jekyll-image-size](https://github.com/generalui/jekyll-image-size)
  - [jekyll-toc](https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc)

## Gemfile

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "jekyll", "~> 4.2.0"
gem "webrick", "~> 1.7"

gem "theme", path: "_theme"

group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-environment-variables'
  gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.12"
  gem "jekyll-image-size", "~> 1.2"
  gem "jekyll-toc"
  gem 'jekyll-gfm-admonitions'
end

# Windows and JRuby does not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem
# and associated library.
platforms :mingw, :x64_mingw, :mswin, :jruby do
  gem "tzinfo", "~> 1.2"
  gem "tzinfo-data"
end

# Performance-booster for watching directories on Windows
gem "wdm", "~> 0.1.1", :platforms => [:mingw, :x64_mingw, :mswin]
```
